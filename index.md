# Hiya! Jose here, and I am a college senior currently enrolled at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) studying Computer Science and Mathematics!

There's one fundamental aspect of myself that has constantly guided
and been reflected in all of my actions: **my love for learning**. 

I love learning about all kinds of things, such as 
   - mathematical theories and ideas
   - the physics laws governing the universe
   - how society and culture has evolved over the years
   - and of course, how computers work. 

> This has led me to pursue Computer Science at UCSD. Computer Science
has the potential to impact any field, regardless of how engineering
focused it is or not. 

Computer Science even has applications in 
- [x] anthropology
- [ ] social studies
- [ ] biology

# As such, this has influenced my mindset when it comes to programming.
I attempt to be conscious of what the code I am developing will
be used for, and how I can improve my code to be useful towards that end.
I realize that my code isn't being used for anything in my classes,
but I want to build that habit for when I enter the industry.

These ideals are partly inspired by [Google's principles on AI](https://ai.google/principles/).

*As a programmer, I also strive to understand every line of code I write*.
I think about the code as I write it and convince myself it's sound,
and if I utilize other libraries and functions not written by me, I check
the documentation to be sure of what the code I'm using does.

Rest assured that I am somewhat optimal with my code. I will not be writing
code such as the code snippet below ~~haha~~:
```
int index = 0;
while (!element.equals(sortedList.get(index))
  && sortedList.size() > ++index);
return index < sortedList.size() ? index : -1;
```

Honestly, my desire to learn is a core aspect of my life and provides
a good idea of what I am like. If you want to know what my favorite
programming language is, check out this link to the README [here](README.md).
